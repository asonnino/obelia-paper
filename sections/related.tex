    Things for a discussion section: (1) Disaster Recovery, you can bow leverage the auxiliary stake to choose the heaviest fork. (2) Link to OFlex as related work. This can also be used in that way although it was not designed for it. (3) Incentives for full nodes. Nodes operators typically have stake and are in a waiting list to become validators, while they wait they are not remunerated; \sysname can help to be a source of remuneration for them. (4) GC round disincentivises auxiliary validators from always proposing blocks linking to old blocks.
