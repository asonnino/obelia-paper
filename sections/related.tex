\section{Discussion and Related Work} \label{sec:related}
To the best of our knowledge, \sysname has no close related work. However, it draws inspiration from DagRider's weak links~\cite{dag-rider}, which include older blocks not required for leader selection (although for different reasons than \sysname), and Narwhal's vertex-creation rule~\cite{narwhal}, which ensures vertex availability before inclusion in the DAG.

Future work include the analysis of \sysname where auxiliary validators operated under the sleepy model~\cite{pass2017sleepy} to explore potential improvements in censorship resistance; whether auxiliary validators can enhance the protocol's safety for clients who trade latency, as in OFlex~\cite{malkhi2019flexible, oflex}; and whether they can aid in fork recovery when more than $f$ Byzantine core validators are present. Lastly, we leave as future work the details of the incentive mechanisms to encourage full nodes to participate as auxiliary validators in \sysname.
