\sysname improves upon structured DAG-based consensus protocols used in proof-of-stake systems, allowing them to effectively scale to accommodate hundreds of validators. \sysname implements a two-tier validator system. A core group of high-stake validators that propose blocks as in current protocols and a larger group of lower-stake auxiliary validators that occasionally author blocks. \sysname incentivizes auxiliary validators to assist recovering core validators and integrates seamlessly with existing protocols. We show that \sysname does not introduce visible overhead compared to the original protocol, even when scaling to hundreds of validators, or when a large number of auxiliary validators are unreliable.
