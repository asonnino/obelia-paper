\sysname is an enhancement over DAG-based consensus protocols deployed in proof-stake environments that enables it to scale to hundreds of validators. \sysname introduces two tiers of validators, a core group of high-stake validators that propose blocks as usual and a larger group of lower-stake auxiliary validators that occasionally author blocks. \sysname incentivizes auxiliary validators to assist recovering core validators and integrates seamlessly with existing protocols. We show that \sysname does not introduce visible overhead compared to the original protocol, even when scaling to hundreds of validators, or when a large number of auxiliary validators are unreliable.
